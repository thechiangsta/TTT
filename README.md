# TTT Roles Generator
---

### Purpose
For you (the user) and friends to be able to play [Trouble in Terrorist Town](https://www.troubleinterroristtown.com/) whether in person or in a video game. With this generator you will be able to use your Gmail account (haven't tried using other email services yet) to send the players' roles as SMS messages.

### Prerequisites
In order to properly use the TTT Roles Generator, you'll need to create an app password for your Google account to use for sending the messages to other players.<br>

  1. Navigate to https://myaccount.google.com/intro/security and under the **Signing in to Google** section, click **App passwords**.
  2. Click the **Select app** dropdown and choose **Other**. You will be prompted to name the password.
  3. Copy the password as you will not be able to retrieve it; and if lost, you will have to create a new password.
